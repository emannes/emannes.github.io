I also:
* graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2016, majoring in math
- have taught about Fourth Amendment law, climate science, nationalism, computer security, math, and lots of other things
- solve puzzles and was on the winning [MIT Mystery Hunt](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/) team in 2012 and 2014
- once was Master Carver (president) of [mitBEEF](http://web.mit.edu/mitbeef/www/), MIT's beef appreciation club
