title: Which president said it?
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

Not much has been written about the Ukranian president's side of the July
25, 2019 [phone
call](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/25/us/politics/trump-ukraine-transcript.html)
with President Trump.[^1] The media has pored over what Trump said, but
what I also found striking was how similar Zelensky's words were to
Trump's. It's as if Zelensky was trying to suck up to Trump by
mimicking him.

Don't believe me? Take this quiz to see if you can try to tell them
apart.[^2]
