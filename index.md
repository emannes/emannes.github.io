## About Me ##

I'm a junior at MIT. I major in math.  I like theoretical computer science. I grew up in NYC. I'm currently a trading intern at Jane Street Capital. You can read [my resume](/files/resume.pdf) or about [some stuff I've done](/projects/). 

I'm involved in several student groups at MIT. I directed Splash 2013 for [MIT ESP](http://esp.mit.edu/). I've been participating in the [MIT Mystery Hunt](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/) since 2010, winning in 2012 and 2014 and writing for 2013 and 2015. I'm also the Master Carver (president) of [mitBEEF](http://web.mit.edu/mitbeef/), MIT's beef appreciation club.
