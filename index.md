## About Me ##

I'm a junior at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, majoring in math.  I like computer science, with a focus on algorithms, data structures, and security. I grew up in New York City. This summer, I was a trading intern at Jane Street Capital. You can read [my resume](/files/resume.pdf) or about [some stuff I've done](/projects/). 

I'm involved in several student groups at MIT. I directed Splash 2013, a weekend-long educational program for 2700 high school students, for [MIT ESP](http://esp.mit.edu/). I've been participating in the [MIT Mystery Hunt](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/) since 2010, on the winning team in 2012 and 2014 and on the writing team for 2013 and 2015. I'm also the Master Carver (president) of [mitBEEF](http://web.mit.edu/mitbeef/), MIT's beef appreciation club.
