## Stuff I've Done ##

### Venmo Security ###

In Spring 2014, I took 6.857 (Computer and Network Security), taught by Ron Rivest. For our final project, Ben Kraft, Jordan Moldow, and I tried to reverse-engineer [Venmo](https://venmo.com), a social payments app.
We disclosed several issues to Venmo, which fixed them and invited us to their offices in NYC to present [our work](/files/venmo.pdf). We were mentioned on [Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/safety_net/2015/02/venmo_security_it_s_not_as_strong_as_the_company_wants_you_to_think.html), [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/tech/s/5-ways-to-yourself-using-mobile-payment-apps-like-venmo-185310508.html), [Sophos' *Naked Security* blog](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2015/03/03/venmo-mobile-payment-service-under-fire-for-security-carelessness/), and [TechTarget](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/2240242041/Venmo-struggles-put-spotlight-on-mobile-payment-security).

### MIT Educational Studies Program ###

I'm an administrator and teacher for the [MIT Educational Studies Program (ESP)](http://esp.mit.edu), a student group at MIT. ESP organizes programs in which college students teach middle- and high-school students about anything.

I co-directed Splash! 2013 for ESP. During Splash, around 2600 high-school students came to the MIT campus for a weekend to attend about 700 classes taught by over 500 volunteer teachers about [almost anything](https://esp.mit.edu/learn/Splash/2013/catalog). I made policy decisions, led a team of over 30 administrators, and coordinated our teachers and over 100 day-of volunteers.

I've taught ESP classes on math, puzzle hunts, cognitive biases, computer security, and beef.

### I-HELP Liberia ###
During the summer of 2013, I went to Liberia for two weeks with the [I-HELP Liberia Project](http://ihelpliberia.org). We developed and taught a teacher training program for 80 high-school math and science teachers in Kakata. We also ran a math contest for high school students in Monrovia.

### MIT Mystery Hunt ###

I've participated in the [MIT Mystery Hunt](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/), an annual puzzle hunt compettion held on MIT's campus, since 2010. In 2012, my team (Manic Sages) won, giving us the honor of writing [the next year's hunt](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2013/). I wrote [a puzzle](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2013/coinheist.com/feynman/funny_story/) and was featured in [another](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2013/coinheist.com/feynman/cambridge_waldo/). In 2014, my new team (One Fish, Two Fish, Random Fish, Blue Fish) won; we wrote the 2015 hunt.

### zScore ###
I helped my friends write [zScore](http://zscore.mit.edu), a website that lets you compete with others to get the most sleep. It's kind of ugly, though.
