## Stuff I've Done ##

### Venmo Security ###

In Spring 2014, I took 6.857 (Computer and Network Security), taught by Ron Rivest. For our final project, Ben Kraft, Jordan Moldow, and I tried to reverse-engineer [Venmo](https://venmo.com), a social payments app. We found several security holes, including one that allowed attackers to steal money from users using SMS spoofing and one that exposed information about some transactions that should have been private. We disclosed these issues to Venmo, which fixed them and invited us to their offices in NYC to present [our work](/files/venmo.pdf).

### MIT Educational Studies Program ###

I'm an administrator and teacher for the [MIT Educational Studies Program (ESP)](http://esp.mit.edu), a student group at MIT. ESP organizes programs in which college students teach middle- and high-school students about anything.

I co-directed Splash 2013, a program of  During Splash, over 2600 high-school students came to the MIT campus for a weekend to attend over 700 classes taught by over 500 volunteers about [almost anything](https://esp.mit.edu/learn/Splash/2013/catalog). I made policy decisions and led a team of over 30 administrators and over 600 day-of volunteers.

I've taught ESP classes on math, puzzle hunts, cognitive biases, and beef.

### I-HELP Liberia ###
During the summer of 2013, I went to Liberia for two weeks with the I-HELP Liberia Project. We developed and taught a teacher training program for 80 high-school math and science teachers in Kakata. We also ran a math contest for high school students in Monrovia.

### MIT Mystery Hunt ###

I've participated in the [MIT Mystery Hunt](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/), an annual puzzle hunt compettion held on MIT's campus, since 2010. In 2012, my team (Manic Sages) won, giving us the honor of writing [the next year's hunt](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2013/). I wrote [a puzzle](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2013/coinheist.com/feynman/funny_story/) and was featured in [another](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2013/coinheist.com/feynman/cambridge_waldo/). In 2014, my new team (One Fish, Two Fish, Random Fish, Blue Fish) won; we're in the process of writing the 2015 hunt.

### zScore ###
I helped my friends write [zScore](http://zscore.mit.edu), a website that lets you compete with your friends to get the most sleep. It's kind of ugly, though.
